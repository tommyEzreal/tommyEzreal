# About
I'm a linked M.S./Ph.D. student in the [Data & Language Intelligence (DLI) Lab](https://diyonsei.notion.site/Data-Language-Intelligence-Lab-Yonsei-University-7e121249362f42c2bdd1328aeaeb5f4b) at Yonsei University, advised by [Prof. Dongha Lee](https://donalee.github.io/).

## ðŸ”Ž Research Interest
My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within the scope of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, I have been particularly interested in:   
- Knolwedge Augmentation of LMs with external knowledge sources 
- Enhancing LM's internal knowledge activation via curating synthetic post-training data and quality control  
- Personalized Agents and User Simulation in diverse real environments
- Reasoning over structured knowledge sources (e.g., tables) with complex information beyond general text
